1 - Part<br />
2 - Drawing<br />
3 - Paperwork<br />
9 - Other<br />

Revision Number<br />

## CAD guidelines
- Always follow the naming convention, if it doesn't fit a use case bring it up at a meeting
- GitHub will handle version control, so old versions of files can be replaced
- Make all sketchs fully contrained
- Name features within parts, other people need to be able to follow your work
- If an assembly is giving you errors, fix the errors.  Don't just live with them
- Before editing an assembly, consult the rest of your subteam
- Give all parts a material so rough weight calculation can be completed
- Design everything in metric, do conversions outside of Inventor
- All 3D modeling should be done in Inventor 2023
